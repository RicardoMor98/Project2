# RPSLS Game - (Rock - Paper - Scissors - Lizard - Spock)
### The game was mentioned in The Big Bang Theory.
### A five-gesture expansion of the classic selection method game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard and Spock.

    - The rules of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock are:

             Scissors cut paper
             Paper covers rock
             Rock crushes lizard
             Lizard poisons Spock
             Spock smashes (or melts) scissors
             Scissors decapitate lizard
             Lizard eats paper
             Paper disproves Spock
             Spock vaporizes rock
             Rock breaks scissors

        - There are ten possible pairings of the five gestures; each gesture beats two of the other gestures and is beaten by the remaining two.
